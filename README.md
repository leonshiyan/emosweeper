## How I planned

Planning materials can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-aAaCdS2Vf3sUTojKHi74zKY1j2Zuwti-eqBWURe8dg/edit).

I chose this game to start because it is an excellent practice of path searching and mapping algorithms.

Although it was hard to make it works as expected at the beginning, I'm glad I made it works at last!
